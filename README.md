# Pluggy

Roblox plugin wrapper library.

<!--moonwave-hide-before-this-line-->

Pluggy is currently under development.

## Goals

-   A library which wraps the Roblox plugin API.
-   A Fusion components library so plugins have the same look as the rest of Studio's UI.
-   A debugger plugin which can run plugins and do hot reloading.
